Main Idea: Code different types of shifts
    -Logical: din0 is discarded and the left side is padded with a 0 (unsigned number)
    -Arithmetic: din0 is discared and the left is padded with the sign og din7 (signed) 
    -Circular:  value that is shifted out of the picture goes to the front or back
    -Barrel: shift by more than one bit, can be circular or arithmetic, just change the numerical value.
        -Barrel can be used for Arithmetic and Ciruclar as well by shifting more than one bit.
