Main Idea:
1. Based on the designed Hamming(7,4) 
encoder in lab 2, design the reverse  
operation, i.e., a decoder in this lab.

2. The input will be a 7-bit Hamming  
code, and the output will be the  
original 4-bit code. You will also  
insert a 1-bit error in the input  
Hamming code and see that it gives 
the correct original code.
